# dl_image_classification
In this project,I classied images from the CIFAR-10 dataset by building a Convulutional Neural Net. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. Two major tasks of the projects are preprocessing the images, and training a convolutional neural network on all the samples. In the image-preprocessing task, I normalized all the images and one-hot encoded the label.In the network building task, I applied convolutional layers, max pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers. At the end, the neural net could recognize images with around 70% accuracy.
